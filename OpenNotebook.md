# Mac or Windows?  I choose neither.
While making my way through the first module of HIST 3907 I came across something that was going to provide me with a challenge.  The instructions for creating an open notebook were only for Windows and Mac users!  Now, I don't have anything against either operating system, but I prefer to do all of my work in Ubuntu for a number of reasons.  First of all, I do not own a Mac.  Secondly, and most importantly, for me, Windows is full of distractions and anytime I try to do some work while on Windows I find myself doing something completely unrelated for an extended period of time.  This often results in some late, stressful nights where I scramble to finish something which I should have finished days ago.  So one day I decided to log onto the other partition on my hard drive which housed Ubuntu and had been ignored for so long.  The results were amazing.  After logging on I found myself in an undisturbed environment with nothing to distract me.  There were no games, movies, or tv shows calling my name begging to be watched.  There was nothing except for the task which needed to be complete.

Since then I have always done my work on Ubuntu.  I find it much easier this way and that is why
