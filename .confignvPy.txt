.confignvPy

.confignvPy
In order to config nvPY I have had to create my own config file in the home directory name ".nvpy.cfg" with the following contents
[nvpy]
notes_as_txt = 1
txt_path = /home/will/hist3907-notebook/
simplenote_sync = 0

This allows nvPY to sav each note as a text file instead of on json file which holds ll of the notes.
two websites which I used for this are
https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy
http://mylinuxlife.com/installing-notational-velocity-and-its-cousin-nvpy/

In order to maintain my notes and be able to retrieve them in nvPY, I also had to register with Simplenote by placing the following code in the .cfg file

sn_username = your_simplenote_username
sn_password = your_simplenote_password

I also had to remove the previous line

simplenote_sync = 0

so that it would sync with SImplenote
