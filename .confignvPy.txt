.confignvPy

In order to config nvPY I have had to create my own config file in the home directory name ".nvpy.cfg"  with the following contents

[nvpy]
notes_as_txt = 1
txt_path = /home/will/hist3907-notebook/
simplenote_sync = 0

This allows nvPY to sav each note as a text file instead of on json file which holds ll of the notes.

two websites which I used for this are
