# HIST 3907
## Why am I taking this course?

Approximately two years ago I began taking a class which would change the way I thought about history and the way in which I would think about conducting historical research.  This class was The Historian's Craft and the professor was Dr. Graham.  In this class he talked about many things which are important to a historian but the thing which interested me the most was the digital aspect of history.  

The idea of digital history is particularly interesting to me because it involves two of my greatest interests coexisting together.  Obviously, those interests are computers and other digital tools, and history.  I have some experience with things digital.  Mainly, I have a basic knowledge of the Python programming language which I learned from [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com).  I have also read some of the [Programming Historian](http://www.programminghistorian.org) sections which pertain to data mining.  I have used the knowledge gained in the two mentioned websites to create a primitive data mining tool. However, my knowledge of using digital tools to do history doesn't extend much further than that.  So basically, what I wish to do with this course is to gain a much wider understanding of digital tools which I can use to conduct research and share it with the rest of the world.  

I think it should be mentioned that I am not a registered student for this course at the moment because I have just recently finished my degree in History at Carleton University.  I found out about this course through [Dr. Graham's twitter account](https://twitter.com/electricarchaeo) and I was delighted to find out that he would be making it public on Github, a tool which I am just beginning to use and learn as well.  I think this is a great thing to do for me at the moment becasue it coincides with my interests and it gives me an opportunity to gain knowledge in the field without having to worry about deadlines and tuition fees. (Although I will be trying to meet any deadlines which Dr. Graham dictates.)
